# Gem Hunter

This is a simple number matching game.  The goal is to reach the exact number shown in the "Allowable Quota" box.  You are given four gem buttons, each with a hidden randomized value from 1-12.  Click on each gem to add this value to your total.  Remember, you want your total to match the quota exactly, so pay attention to how many points are being added after clicking each gem.  

## Getting Started

This project can be found in my github portfolio here: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/unit-4-game

The live page can be found here: https://joelearns2code.github.io/unit-4-game/

Additionally, this page can be accessed from my portfolio page here: https://joelearns2code.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/portfolio.html

### Prerequisites

You will need access to a common web browser to view the live page.  The data can also be pulled directly from GitHub via GitBash on PC or via Terminal on Mac.


### Installing

When you have accessed the repository page on GitHub, you may simply download a Zip file and extract it to a directory of your choosing.  Alternatively, you may download the data directly to your device via GitBash if you have an SSH key.  More on adding an SSH key can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

To download via GitBash, once you have a working SSH key with GitHub, create a folder you wish to download data into.  Next, click on the green 'Download or Clone' button on the GitHub respoitory page.  Make sure you have SSH key selected(and not HTTPS), and click on the clipboard icon.  This copies the address to your clipboard.

Next, navigate to the folder you wish to download the data into via GitBash or Terminal, and then simply type "git clone" followed by the link you copied onto your clipboard(paste via ctrl/cmd+v).  Press the enter key, and GitBash will pull the entire repository into your folder.
